    "This data set was compiled by a research group at UBC who were observing how players interacted with a Minecraft server. By analyzing this dataset, we are interested in seeing which types of players contribute to high volumes of data, indicating that they may be worth pursuing for recruitment. Specifically, we would like to know if player age can be a predictor for whether a player is a low, hour, medium-hour, or high-hour player. Using this predictive model, we can then better understand which types of players are more likely to heavily interact with the game, and as such, are worth targeting for recruitment. \n",
